# Arabic-English-Subtitling
Automatic Video Subtitling System for Arabic/English Using Speech Recognition 

The goal of this project is to develop an application that allows subtitling of English andArabic.  The application will provide the user with a full subtitle le ready to be usedby the user.  The subtitling will be based on the CMU-Sphinx speech recognition enginewhich is open source GNU software.  In this project, the ASR engine will be mostly usedas a black box and the role of the student would be to understand how to integrate theengine with his application.
